# Risk Factor of Cardiovascular Diseases

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) refers to a class of diseases that involve the heart or blood vessels, including conditions such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, and stroke. It has been a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide for many decades, largely due to the global prevalence of risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, and tobacco use.

### Historical Background

The study and understanding of cardiovascular disease have evolved significantly over time. In the early 20th century, CVD was relatively uncommon, but as industrialization and lifestyle changes took hold, it became a major public health issue. The Framingham Heart Study, initiated in 1948, was one of the first large-scale epidemiological studies to investigate the risk factors associated with CVD, leading to the identification of hypertension, high cholesterol, smoking, and obesity as major contributors to heart disease.

Over the decades, advancements in medical research and technology have greatly improved the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Innovations such as the development of statins, the advent of coronary artery bypass surgery, and the use of stents have significantly reduced the mortality associated with CVD. Public health campaigns have also played a crucial role in raising awareness about heart health and promoting lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of CVD.

### Modern Perspective

Despite these advances, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death globally, accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths each year according to the World Health Organization. The burden of CVD is particularly high in low- and middle-income countries, where access to healthcare and preventive measures are often limited.

Research continues to focus on understanding the complex interactions between genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors that contribute to CVD. Current efforts include the development of more personalized approaches to treatment and prevention, the use of advanced imaging techniques for early detection, and the integration of big data and machine learning to predict cardiovascular risk more accurately.

Qur research project on the risk factors of cardiovascular diseases fits into this broader context by using logistic regression to identify key predictors of CVD, contributing to the ongoing efforts to combat this global health challenge.

It was presented at the Illinois State University research symposium under the mentorship of Professor Olcay Akman. Our team analyzed a dataset of 70,000 individuals, focusing on demographic, biological, and health-related factors such as age, gender, weight, cholesterol, glucose levels, and blood pressure. Utilizing logistic regression, we developed a predictive model that achieved a 73\% accuracy rate in identifying the presence of cardiovascular diseases. Here iis a link to the poster we presented
