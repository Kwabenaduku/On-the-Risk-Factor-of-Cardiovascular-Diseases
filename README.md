# Risk Factor of Cardiovascular Diseases
\textbf{On the Risk Factors of Cardiovascular Diseases}

I contributed to a research project titled \textbf{"On the Risk Factors of Cardiovascular Diseases"} presented at the Illinois State University research symposium under the mentorship of Professor Olcay Akman. Our team analyzed a dataset of 70,000 individuals, focusing on demographic, biological, and health-related factors such as age, gender, weight, cholesterol, glucose levels, and blood pressure. Utilizing logistic regression, we developed a predictive model that achieved a 73\% accuracy rate in identifying the presence of cardiovascular diseases.
